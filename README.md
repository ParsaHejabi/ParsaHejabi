Hello there 👋🏻

My name is Parsa Hejabi 👾

I'm a third-year PhD student in Computer Science. In my projects, I focused more on Large Language Models (LLMs), making them more consistent and robust to prompt perturbations and evaluating their creativity and deception power in a game simulation like [Balderdash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balderdash).
